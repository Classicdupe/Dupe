# How we manage this repo
When adding commits and working on tasks for the main plugin, things can get messy and mixed up. So we have a system for developing on this plugin. 

### This Season Label
If your task labeled to be implemented this season, you can either commit directly to the main branch or create a branch with main as the source. 

### Next Season Label
If your task is labeled to be implemented next season, you can either commit directly to the next seasons branch or create a branch with that seasons branch as the source.

### When to create a branch or commit directly?
If you are working on a bug patch or a minor implementation, you can commit it directly to your source AS LONG AS IT HAS BEEN THOROUGHLY TESTED. 
If you are working on a feature or enhancement, please create a seperate branch and create a pull request once you are ready. Do not merge this yourself, please wait until someone has reviewed the code or Prorickey will merge it himself.
